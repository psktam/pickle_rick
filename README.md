# pickle_rick
So i was watching rick and morty right, and it was just a casual 
night and i was just watching rick and morty. Well, out of nowhere 
the funniest shit happened. Rick and Morty, Season 3, Episode 3, 
56 seconds in. At the time, this was happening, The scientist guy,
Rick, was nowhere to be found. Morty tried to look for him but all 
he found was just a mere little pickle on the desk. You know what 
happened? He heard ricks voice, somewhere around the room. Morty 
used a screwdriver to flip the pickle over and...you’ll never 
believe this, IT WAS RICK! HE WAS A PICKLE!! I kid you not, he’s 
called PICKLE RICK! PICKLE RICK!!! LMAO!!!! I was rolling on the 
floor laughing! My chest was in pain and i almost felt that i was 
going to suffocate!! Funniest shit i’d ever seen, i’ll tell you 
that. Im still laughing thinking about it. Awww man, you had to 
be there. It was just so funny.
